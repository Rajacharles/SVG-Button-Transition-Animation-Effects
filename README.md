SVG Button Transition Animation Effects | HTML5 | CSS3

SVGs are infinitely scalable, responsive, have smaller file sizes, are future-proof for next-generation bazillion-pixel dense screens, and can be styled, animated and interacted with using CSS, and JavaScript. It's like animating with a shape layer in After Effects. It's like having a GIF that you can scale, style, and tweak!
